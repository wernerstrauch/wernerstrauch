      faqs:
        - question: "Who is your consulting for?"
          answer: "For e-commerce companies in the DACH region with annual revenue between 500k and 50M that face technical or strategic decisions – whether ERP change, shop migration, or process optimization."
        - question: "Are you an agency?"
          answer: "No. I consult independently and vendor-neutrally. If needed, I can tap into my network or support implementation through digitalsprung – but only if it makes sense for you."

        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually within 1-2 weeks. For urgent matters, we'll find a solution."
        - question: "Do you work remotely?"
          answer: "Yes, primarily remote. For workshops or intensive project phases, I also come on-site."
