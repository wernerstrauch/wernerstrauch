      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-light font-medium underline transition-colors">Contact me</a> for a non-binding conversation.'
      faqs:
        - question: "Who is your consulting suitable for?"
          answer: "For e-commerce companies in the DACH region generating between €500k and €50 million in annual revenue, facing technical or strategic decisions – whether ERP change, shop migration or process optimization."
        - question: "Are you an agency?"
          answer: "No. I consult independently and vendor-neutral. If needed, I can draw on my network or support implementation through digitalsprung – but only if it makes sense for you."
        - question: "What does a collaboration cost?"
          answer: "That depends on the scope. An audit is calculated project-based, strategic sparring is available as a monthly retainer model. In the initial call, we clarify what fits you and you'll receive a transparent offer."
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually within 1-2 weeks. For urgent matters, we'll find a solution."
        - question: "Do you work remotely?"
          answer: "Yes, primarily remote. For workshops or intensive project phases, I also come on-site."
