        - title: "The Key Trends Shaping Your Strategy"
          content: |
            <p>The e-commerce landscape is evolving fast. A future-proof strategy needs to account for current trends - without chasing every shiny object. Here's what should be on your radar:</p>
            <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> From personalized product recommendations to smart search to automated customer service - AI is becoming table stakes. The strategic question isn't whether to use AI, but how to use it effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Direct-to-Consumer (D2C):</strong> More brands are going direct. D2C means higher margins, direct customer feedback, and full control over the customer experience - but it also demands new capabilities.</p>
        - title: "Omnichannel and Composable Commerce"
          content: |
            <p><strong>Omnichannel Integration:</strong> Customers expect seamless experiences across every channel. The hard line between online and offline is blurring. Strategies that treat channels as silos miss the mark.</p>
            <p><strong>Composable Commerce:</strong> Monolithic systems are giving way to modular architectures. Best-of-breed approaches offer more flexibility - but also require more integration work. Technology strategy is getting more complex.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Commerce:</strong> TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, live shopping - social platforms are becoming sales channels. For some audiences, this is already the main touchpoint.</p>
        - title: "Strategy Over Hype-Chasing"
          content: |
            <p>With all these trends, one thing holds true: A good strategy doesn't mean doing everything. It means making deliberate choices about what fits your business - and what doesn't. Not every trend matters for every company.</p>
            <p>A solid e-commerce strategy helps you set the right priorities and put your resources where they'll have the biggest impact. Together, we figure out which trends actually matter for you.</p>
        - title: "Strategy Grounded in Analysis"

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "Who needs strategy consulting?"
          answer: "E-commerce strategy is ideal for online retailers and D2C brands at a crossroads: pivoting, scaling, expanding internationally, or making major technology investments. It's also for you if your e-commerce 'kind of works' but you're missing a clear direction."
        - question: "How is your strategy consulting different from agencies?"
          answer: "I don't sell implementation. My recommendations are free from software partnerships or agency agendas. I sit on your side of the table and help you find the right partners - but I'm not trying to sell you anything beyond the strategy itself."
        - question: "How long does strategy development take?"
          answer: "Anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks, depending on scope. A focused project (like channel strategy) takes about 2-3 weeks. A comprehensive e-commerce strategy with business case and detailed roadmap runs 4-6 weeks. We'll nail down the right scope in our initial call."
        - question: "What does an e-commerce strategy cost?"
          answer: "Focused strategy projects start at EUR 3,500. Comprehensive strategy work with business case, roadmap, and KPI framework typically runs EUR 8,000 to EUR 15,000, depending on complexity and scope. I'll give you a ballpark estimate on our initial call."
        - question: "What do I get at the end?"
          answer: "A comprehensive strategy document covering: Executive Summary, market and competitive analysis, strategic positioning, channel strategy, technology roadmap, business case with financial model, prioritized action plan, and KPI framework. Not a PowerPoint graveyard - a working document you'll actually use."
        - question: "Do you support implementation too?"
          answer: "Yes, if you want. Some clients take the strategy and run with it themselves. Others want ongoing support during implementation - as a <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>sparring partner</a>, <a href='/implementation-support'>implementation advisor</a>, or in an <a href='/interim-management'>interim role</a>. Either approach works."
        - question: "How does the initial call work?"
          answer: "The initial call is free and takes about 30 minutes. We talk through your current situation, goals, and challenges. I share my initial take, and we figure out if working together makes sense. No strings attached, no hidden costs."
        - question: "Can you help with technology selection?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Technology strategy is a key piece of the overall puzzle. Whether it's your e-commerce platform, ERP, PIM, or marketing automation - I help you design the right architecture and can guide you through the selection process if needed."
