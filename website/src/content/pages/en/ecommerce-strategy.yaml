        - title: "The Most Important Trends for Your Strategy"
          content: |
            <p>The e-commerce landscape is changing rapidly. A future-proof strategy must consider current trends – without chasing every hype. These developments should be on your radar:</p>
            <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> From personalized product recommendations to intelligent search to automated customer service – AI is becoming standard. The strategic question is not whether, but how you use AI meaningfully.</p>
            <p><strong>Direct-to-Consumer (D2C):</strong> More and more brands are focusing on direct customer contact. D2C enables higher margins, direct customer feedback and full control over the customer experience – but also requires new competencies.</p>
        - title: "Omnichannel and Composable Commerce"
          content: |
            <p><strong>Omnichannel Integration:</strong> Customers expect seamless experiences across all channels. The strict separation of online and offline is dissolving. Strategies that still consider channels in isolation fall short.</p>
            <p><strong>Composable Commerce:</strong> Monolithic systems are giving way to modular architectures. Best-of-breed approaches enable more flexibility – but also require more integration effort. Technology strategy becomes more complex.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Commerce:</strong> TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, live shopping – social media platforms are becoming sales channels. For some target groups, this is already the primary touchpoint.</p>
        - title: "Strategy Instead of Activism"
          content: |
            <p>With all the trends, one thing applies: A good strategy doesn't mean doing everything. It means consciously deciding what fits your business – and what doesn't. Not every trend is relevant for every company.</p>
            <p>A well-founded e-commerce strategy helps you set the right priorities and deploy your resources where they have the greatest leverage. Together we find out which developments are relevant for you.</p>
        - title: "Strategy Based on Analysis"
          content: |
            <p>A well-founded strategy is based on clear data. If you haven't done an assessment yet, an <a href="/ecommerce-audit">E-Commerce Audit</a> can provide the foundation for strategic decisions.</p>

      headline: "Questions About <em>E-Commerce Strategy</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "Who benefits from strategy consulting?"
          answer: "An e-commerce strategy makes sense for online retailers and D2C brands facing important decisions: realignment, scaling, internationalization, or major technology investments. Also if you feel your e-commerce 'somehow works' but lacks clear direction."
        - question: "What distinguishes your strategy consulting from agencies?"
          answer: "I don't sell implementation services. My strategy recommendations are independent of software partnerships or agency interests. I'm on your side of the table and help you find the right partners – but I'm not a vendor myself."
        - question: "How long does strategy development take?"
          answer: "Depending on scope, between 2 and 6 weeks. A focused strategy project (e.g., channel strategy) takes about 2-3 weeks. A comprehensive e-commerce strategy with business case and detailed roadmap 4-6 weeks. In the initial call, we clarify the appropriate scope."
        - question: "What does an e-commerce strategy cost?"
          answer: "A focused strategy project starts at €3,500. Comprehensive strategy development with business case, roadmap, and KPI framework typically ranges between €8,000 and €15,000 – depending on complexity and scope. In the initial call, I provide an initial estimate."
        - question: "What do I get as a result?"
          answer: "A comprehensive strategy document with: Executive Summary, market and competitive analysis, strategic positioning, channel strategy, technology roadmap, business case with financial model, prioritized action plan, and KPI framework. Not a PowerPoint graveyard, but a working document."
        - question: "Do you also accompany implementation?"
          answer: "Yes, if desired. Some clients use the strategy as a basis for their own implementation. Others want continuous support during implementation – as a <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>sparring partner</a>, <a href='/implementation-support'>implementation supporter</a>, or in an <a href='/interim-management'>interim role</a>. Both are possible."
        - question: "How does the initial call work?"
          answer: "The initial call is free and takes about 30 minutes. We discuss your current situation, goals, and challenges. I provide initial assessments and we clarify whether a collaboration makes sense. Non-binding and without hidden costs."
        - question: "Can you also help with technology selection?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Technology strategy is an important part of the overall strategy. Whether shop system, ERP, PIM, or marketing automation – I help you develop the right architecture and, if desired, also accompany the selection process."
