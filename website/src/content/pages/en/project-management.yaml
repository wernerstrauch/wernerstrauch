        - title: "Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid?"
          content: |
            <p>There's no one-size-fits-all methodology. The right approach depends on your project, team, and constraints. For store relaunches with a well-defined scope, classic waterfall often works best. With agile dev teams, I adapt to Scrum or Kanban. Often, a hybrid approach makes the most sense: fixed milestones and budget, with agile execution in sprints.</p>
            <p>But here's the thing – the methodology matters less than consistency. Clear rituals, transparent communication, regular check-ins. I bring the discipline and tailor it to how your organization actually works.</p>
        - title: "The Three Success Factors"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Clear Ownership:</strong> Who makes which decisions? Who delivers what? Who has final sign-off? Fuzzy accountability is the number one reason projects drag on. I establish a RACI matrix that everyone actually understands and follows.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Data Quality:</strong> For migrations and ERP implementations, your data quality will make or break you. Messy master data, incomplete product information, inconsistent customer records – these all blow up at go-live. I start the cleanup process early.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Communication:</strong> Projects fail because of misunderstandings, not technology. I set up clear communication channels: who updates whom, how often, and through what medium. Regular status updates keep everyone on the same page.</p>
        - title: "Typical Project Risks"
          content: |
            <p>After dozens of e-commerce projects, I've seen the same traps over and over: scope creep, unrealistic timelines, underestimated integration complexity, skipped testing phases, stakeholders who aren't looped in early enough. The difference an experienced project manager makes? Spotting these risks before they derail your timeline – and course-correcting while there's still time.</p>

      headline: "Questions About <em>Project Management</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "At what point does external project management make sense?"
          answer: "Once you have more than three parties involved (internal team, agency, software vendor, for example) or your project budget exceeds €50,000. For smaller initiatives, occasional <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>Sparring</a> or <a href='/implementation-support'>Implementation Support</a> often does the trick. We'll figure out what's right for your situation in our initial call."
        - question: "Do you handle technical implementation yourself?"
          answer: "No, I don't write code. My role is pure project management: coordinating agencies, developers, and internal teams, checking quality, and keeping things on schedule. Staying out of the technical weeds means I can remain objective and hold everyone accountable."
        - question: "How much time do you typically dedicate per week?"
          answer: "It depends on where we are in the project. During intensive phases like kickoff and go-live, it might be full-time. During steady-state execution, typically 1-2 days per week. We agree on a monthly commitment with built-in flexibility to scale up or down as needed."
        - question: "Can you step into a project that's already underway?"
          answer: "Absolutely – that's actually a common scenario. When projects go sideways, I come in, assess the situation, identify what's broken, and get things back on track. A project turnaround is often more effective (and cheaper) than starting over."
        - question: "What does external project management cost?"
          answer: "Starting at €4,000 per month, depending on scope and how hands-on you need me to be. Full-time engagements or highly complex projects run higher. But compare that to the cost of delays and budget blowouts – professional project management pays for itself."
        - question: "Do you work on-site or remotely?"
          answer: "Both. I'm happy to be on-site for kickoff workshops and critical decision points. Day-to-day coordination often works more efficiently remotely. Most clients find a hybrid model works best – we'll figure out the right balance for your project."
        - question: "What tools do you use?"
          answer: "I adapt to your existing stack. Whether it's Jira, Asana, Monday, Notion, or good old Excel and PowerPoint – the tool matters less than using it consistently. If you don't have a project management tool in place yet, I can recommend what fits your needs."
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually within 2-4 weeks. For urgent situations or projects in crisis, I can often move faster. Let's discuss your timeline and my availability in our initial call."
