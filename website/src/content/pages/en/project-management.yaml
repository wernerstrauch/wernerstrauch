        - title: "Agile, Waterfall or Hybrid?"
          content: |
            <p>There is no single right project methodology. The choice depends on project, team and conditions. For shop relaunches with clear scope, a classic waterfall approach often works well. With agile development teams, I adapt to Scrum or Kanban. Often a hybrid approach makes sense: Fixed milestones and budget, but agile implementation in sprints.</p>
            <p>More important than the methodology is consistent application: Clear rituals, transparent communication, regular reviews. I bring the structure – and adapt it to your organization.</p>
        - title: "The Three Success Factors"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Clear Responsibilities:</strong> Who decides what? Who delivers what? Who signs off? Unclear responsibilities are the most common reason for project delays. I ensure a RACI matrix that everyone understands.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Data Quality:</strong> For migrations and ERP implementations, data quality is critical. Poor master data, incomplete product information or inconsistent customer histories become problems at the latest at go-live. I initiate data cleanup early.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Communication:</strong> Projects fail due to misunderstandings, not technology. I establish clear communication channels: Who informs whom, how often, through which channel? Regular status updates keep all stakeholders informed.</p>
        - title: "Typical Project Risks"
          content: |
            <p>After dozens of e-commerce projects, I know the typical traps: Scope creep (scope grows uncontrolled), unrealistic timelines, underestimated integration effort, missing test phases, insufficient stakeholder involvement. As an experienced project manager, I recognize these risks early and steer against them – before they become problems.</p>

      headline: "Questions About <em>Project Management</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "From what project size does external project management make sense?"
          answer: "As soon as more than three parties are involved (e.g., internal team, agency, software vendor) or the project budget exceeds €50,000. For smaller projects, occasional <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>Sparring</a> or <a href='/implementation-support'>Implementation Support</a> is often sufficient. In the initial call, we clarify what makes sense for your project."
        - question: "Do you also take on technical implementation?"
          answer: "No, I don't develop myself. My role is management: I coordinate agency, developers and internal teams, check quality and keep the schedule. This keeps me independent and able to evaluate objectively."
        - question: "How much time do you invest per week?"
          answer: "That depends on the project phase. In intensive phases (kickoff, go-live), it can be full-time. In regular project progress, typically 1-2 days per week. We agree on a monthly quota with flexibility up and down."
        - question: "Can you also take over ongoing projects?"
          answer: "Yes, that's actually often the case. When projects run off track, I take over management: assessment, identify problems, correct course. A 'project turnaround' is often more effective than starting from scratch."
        - question: "What does external project management cost?"
          answer: "From €4,000 per month, depending on project scope and required intensity. For full-time engagements or particularly complex projects, correspondingly more. Compared to project delays and budget overruns, professional project management is an investment that pays off."
        - question: "Do you work on-site or remote?"
          answer: "Both are possible. I'm happy to be on-site for kickoff workshops and critical discussions. Ongoing coordination often works more efficiently remote. A mix of both has proven itself – we find the right model for your project."
        - question: "What tools do you use?"
          answer: "I adapt to your tool landscape. Whether Jira, Asana, Monday, Notion or classic Excel and PowerPoint – more important than the tool is consistent use. If you don't have a project management tool yet, I recommend a suitable setup."
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually within 2-4 weeks. For urgent projects or crisis situations, even faster. In the initial call, we clarify your timeline and my availability."
