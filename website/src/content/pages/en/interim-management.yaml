        - title: "Definition and Differentiation"
          content: |
            <p>Interim management means stepping into a leadership role temporarily with full operational accountability. Unlike a consultant who advises from the outside, an interim manager operates within your organization – with decision-making authority, budget ownership, and clear performance targets.</p>
            <p>Typical engagements run 3 to 12 months. Commitment can be full-time (5 days/week) or part-time (2-3 days/week) – whatever the situation calls for.</p>
        - title: "Typical Roles in E-Commerce"
          content: |
            <p><strong>Head of E-Commerce / E-Commerce Director:</strong> Owns all online revenue, leads the e-commerce team, and manages the platform, marketing, and operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Chief Digital Officer (CDO):</strong> Drives the company's digital transformation at the executive level.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Sales Director:</strong> Focuses on digital channels, marketplaces, and online growth strategy.</p>
            <p><strong>Project/Program Manager:</strong> Leads major transformation initiatives like platform relaunches, ERP implementations, or international expansion.</p>
        - title: "Why Interim Beats a Lengthy Hiring Process"
          content: |
            <p>An interim manager brings ready-to-deploy experience without the months-long recruiting cycle. They offer a fresh outside perspective, aren't weighed down by internal politics, and bring proven playbooks from other organizations.</p>
            <p>The fixed timeline creates flexibility: you pay only for as long as you need the expertise. And a seasoned interim manager is laser-focused on results from day one – they know their success is measured by what they deliver, not how long they stick around.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Typically within 2-4 weeks of signing. In urgent situations, faster starts are possible. We'll nail down exact availability on our first call."
        - question: "What does interim management cost?"
          answer: "Day rates range from EUR 1,150 to EUR 1,500, depending on role, complexity, and engagement model. For longer full-time engagements, monthly retainers are an option. Travel is billed separately."
        - question: "Full-time or part-time – which makes sense?"
          answer: "It depends. For a crisis or leadership vacancy, full-time (5 days/week) usually makes sense. For transformation support or project oversight, 2-3 days often does the job. We'll figure out the right fit together."
        - question: "How is this different from working with an agency?"
          answer: "An agency delivers services – design, development, marketing. An interim manager takes on leadership responsibility inside your company. I'll manage agencies when needed, but I'm embedded in your team, not an outside vendor."
        - question: "What happens when the engagement ends?"
          answer: "The goal is always a clean handover – either to your new permanent hire (whom I'll help onboard) or to your existing team with documented processes. If helpful, I can stay available as a sounding board or advisor."
        - question: "Do you actually manage people?"
          answer: "Absolutely – that's core to interim management. I lead your team, run one-on-ones, set goals, and develop people. Just like an internal executive. That's the fundamental difference from pure consulting."
        - question: "Can you work remotely?"
          answer: "Usually a hybrid approach works best. On-site presence matters early on for building relationships and gaining context. Once things are running, the remote share can increase. Fully remote is possible in some cases."
        - question: "What industries do you cover?"
          answer: "My sweet spot is B2C e-commerce, D2C brands, and omnichannel retail. I've worked across fashion, consumer electronics, FMCG, and B2B. We can talk through fit on our first call."
