        - title: "Definition and Differentiation"
          content: |
            <p>Interim management means temporarily taking over a leadership position with full operational responsibility. Unlike a consultant who recommends from outside, an interim manager works within the company – with authority, budget responsibility and clear result targets.</p>
            <p>Typical mandate duration is between 3 and 12 months. Engagement can be full-time (5 days/week) or part-time (2-3 days/week) – depending on situation and requirements.</p>
        - title: "Typical Roles in E-Commerce"
          content: |
            <p><strong>Head of E-Commerce / E-Commerce Director:</strong> Responsibility for all online sales, leadership of the e-commerce team, management of shop, marketing and operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Chief Digital Officer (CDO):</strong> Strategic responsibility for the company's digital transformation, often at C-level.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Sales Director:</strong> Focus on digital sales channels, marketplaces and online growth.</p>
            <p><strong>Project/Program Manager:</strong> Responsibility for large transformation projects like shop relaunch, ERP implementation or internationalization.</p>
        - title: "Advantages Over Permanent Hire"
          content: |
            <p>An interim manager brings immediately available experience without lengthy recruiting. He has a fresh outside perspective, is unburdened by internal sensitivities and brings best practices from other companies.</p>
            <p>The time limit creates flexibility: You only pay as long as you need the expertise. And an experienced interim manager works results-oriented from day 1 – he knows his success is measured by measurable results.</p>

      headline: "Questions About <em>Interim Management</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually within 2-4 weeks after commissioning. In acute crisis situations, a faster start is also possible. In the initial call, we clarify exact availability."
        - question: "What does interim management cost?"
          answer: "Daily rate is between €1,150 and €1,500, depending on role, complexity and engagement model. For full-time mandates over several months, flat-rate models are also possible. Travel costs are billed separately."
        - question: "Full-time or part-time – what makes sense?"
          answer: "That depends on the situation. In a crisis or with a leadership vacancy, full-time (5 days/week) usually makes sense. For transformation support or project oversight, 2-3 days/week is often enough. We find the right model."
        - question: "How is this different from an agency?"
          answer: "An agency delivers services (design, development, marketing). An interim manager takes on leadership responsibility within your company. I manage agencies when needed – but as part of your team, not as an external service provider."
        - question: "What happens after the mandate?"
          answer: "The goal is always a clean handover. Either to a new permanent manager, whom I support during onboarding, or to your existing team with documented processes and structures. On request, I remain available in the background as a sparring partner or advisor."
        - question: "Do you also take on employee leadership?"
          answer: "Yes, that's an essential part of interim management. I lead your team, hold one-on-ones, set goals and develop employees – like an internal manager. This is the central difference from pure consulting."
        - question: "Do you also work remote?"
          answer: "A mix of on-site and remote is usually sensible. Especially in the initial phase, on-site presence is important for team leadership and stakeholder management. After that, the remote portion can increase. Pure remote mandates are possible in exceptions."
        - question: "What industry experience do you have?"
          answer: "My focus is on B2C e-commerce, D2C brands and omnichannel retail. I have experience in fashion, consumer electronics, FMCG and B2B. In the initial call, we clarify whether my expertise fits your situation."
