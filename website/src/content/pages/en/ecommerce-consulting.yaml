        - title: "More Than Just Marketing"
          content: |
            <p>Many people think e-commerce consulting is mainly about ads, SEO, or conversion rates. That matters - but it is only part of the story. Real, lasting e-commerce success happens when strategy, processes, and technology all work together.</p>
            <p>A store with great marketing but broken fulfillment will not scale. A technically brilliant store with no clear positioning will fight for every sale. That is why I always take a holistic view of e-commerce.</p>
        - title: "The Four Pillars of Successful Online Retailers"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Strategy & Business Model:</strong> Who are your customers? What is your positioning? What are your growth levers? A clear strategy is the foundation for every operational decision.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Processes & Operations:</strong> From order intake to returns - efficient processes are the backbone of scalable e-commerce. Automate where it makes sense, keep human expertise where it counts.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Technology & Systems:</strong> Shop platform, ERP, PIM, CRM, marketing automation - the right tech architecture makes all the difference. It is not about the most expensive tool, but the right fit.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Market & Competition:</strong> Who are your competitors? Where is your market heading? Which trends matter? Solid market knowledge is the basis for smart strategic moves.</p>
        - title: "When Do Retailers Seek Consulting?"
          content: |
            <p>Online retailers bring in consultants at different stages: before a platform migration or ERP rollout, when growth stalls, before expanding internationally, when preparing for investors or an exit, or simply to get an outside perspective on their business.</p>
            <p>Many clients start with an <a href="/ecommerce-audit">E-Commerce Audit</a> to get a clear picture of where they stand. For bigger strategic moves, I recommend an <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a> - a document that puts every decision into a broader context.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "Who is this consulting for?"
          answer: "I work with established online retailers and D2C brands facing strategic decisions - whether that is a platform migration, process optimization, or a broader realignment. Ideally, you already have a working store and are looking to take the next step."
        - question: "What makes you different from an agency?"
          answer: "I do not sell implementation services. My recommendations are not tied to software partnerships or commissions. If you need an agency, I will help you find the right one - but I stay on your side of the table."
        - question: "Do you advise on ERP or platform selection?"
          answer: "Yes, it is one of my specialties. I guide you through the entire selection process: from requirements analysis to market overview to final vendor decision. I focus on fit with your business model, not feature checklists."
        - question: "How does the discovery call work?"
          answer: "The discovery call is free and takes about 30 minutes. We talk through your current situation, your goals, and whether working together makes sense. I share my initial thoughts - no strings attached and no hidden fees."
        - question: "Do you get hands-on with execution?"
          answer: "It depends on what you need. The range goes from pure strategic advice to project coaching to interim project leadership. During system rollouts, I often step in as the owner-side project lead."
        - question: "What does e-commerce consulting cost?"
          answer: "It depends on scope. A one-time audit starts at 2,500 euros, ongoing support from 1,500 euros per month. For larger projects like ERP selection, I put together a custom proposal. We can figure out what makes sense for you on the discovery call."
