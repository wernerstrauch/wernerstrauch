      sections:
        - title: "More Than Just Marketing"
          content: |
            <p>Many understand e-commerce consulting primarily as optimizing ads, SEO or conversion rates. That's important – but it's only part of the picture. Sustainable e-commerce success happens when strategy, processes and technology work together.</p>
            <p>A shop with perfect marketing but inefficient fulfillment processes doesn't scale. A technically brilliant shop without clear positioning struggles for every customer. That's why I always look at e-commerce holistically.</p>
        - title: "The Four Pillars of Successful Online Retailers"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Strategy & Business Model:</strong> Who are your customers? What's your positioning? What growth levers do you have? A clear strategy is the foundation for all operational decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Processes & Operations:</strong> From order receipt to returns – efficient processes are the backbone of scalable e-commerce. Automation where sensible, human expertise where necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Technology & Systems:</strong> Shop system, ERP, PIM, CRM, marketing automation – the right technology architecture makes the difference. Not the most expensive tool wins, but the right fit.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Market & Competition:</strong> Who are your competitors? How is your market developing? Which trends are relevant? Sound market knowledge enables strategic decisions.</p>
        - title: "Typical Consulting Occasions"
          content: |
            <p>Online retailers seek consulting in various situations: Before a shop migration or ERP implementation, with stagnating growth, before internationalization, when preparing for investors or sale, or simply to get an external perspective on their own business.</p>
            <p>Many clients start with an <a href="/ecommerce-audit">E-Commerce Audit</a> to get clarity about the status quo. For strategic decisions, I recommend an <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a> – a document that puts all decisions in a larger context.</p>

      faqs:
        - question: "Who is the consulting suitable for?"
          answer: "My consulting is aimed at established online retailers and D2C brands facing strategic decisions – whether it's a system migration, process optimization or realignment. Ideally, you already have a functioning shop and are looking for the next growth step."
        - question: "What distinguishes you from an agency?"
          answer: "I don't sell implementation services. My recommendations are independent of software partnerships or commissions. If you need an agency, I'll help you find the right one – but I stay on your side of the table."
        - question: "Do you also consult on ERP or shop selection?"
          answer: "Yes, that's one of my specialties. I accompany the entire selection process: From requirements analysis to market overview to vendor selection. I focus on fit with the business model, not feature lists."
        - question: "How does the initial call work?"
          answer: "The initial call is free and takes about 30 minutes. We discuss your current situation, your goals and whether a collaboration makes sense. I provide initial assessments – non-binding and without hidden costs."
        - question: "Do you also work operationally?"
          answer: "Depending on your needs. The spectrum ranges from pure strategic consulting to project coaching to interim project management. During system implementations, I often accompany as owner on the client side."
        - question: "What does e-commerce consulting cost?"
          answer: "Costs depend on scope. A one-time audit starts at €2,500, ongoing support from €1,500/month. For larger projects like ERP selection, I create individual proposals. In the initial call, we clarify what makes sense for you."
