        - title: "Liability for Content"
          content: |
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

        - title: "Liability for Links"
          content: |
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.

            However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
