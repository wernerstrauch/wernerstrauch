        - "<p>As CEO, I've spent the last <strong>7 years</strong> learning what it really takes to make strategic decisions and run a company. Previously, I led a <strong>20-person team</strong> – today I lead a <strong>15-person agency</strong> at digitalsprung.</p>"
        - "<p>Alongside that, I spent 7 years in online marketing for financial services – a masterclass in performance, conversion, and data-driven thinking. This blend of <strong>technical depth, leadership experience, and strategic vision</strong> is what I bring to every engagement.</p>"
        - "<p>With a business degree focused on IT, I bridge all these worlds: I speak developers' language, I know what it takes to lead teams, and I understand what executives need. That makes me the translator between tech, people, and the business.</p>"
