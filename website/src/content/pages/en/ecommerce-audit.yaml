      sections:
        - title: "More Than an Automated Report"
          content: |
            <p>Every SEO tool produces an "audit" at the push of a button. But these automated reports only scratch the surface. A professional e-commerce audit goes deeper: it combines technical analysis with business understanding and considers your specific situation.</p>
            <p>The real work isn't in collecting data – but in interpreting and prioritizing. What does a specific finding mean for <em>your</em> business? How urgent is it? Which measure has the greatest leverage?</p>
        - title: "The Six Pillars of a Comprehensive Audit"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Shop & User Experience:</strong> How do real customers experience your shop? Navigation, product presentation, checkout – every touchpoint is examined for conversion killers.</p>
            <p><strong>2. SEO & Visibility:</strong> Technical SEO, on-page factors, content quality – how well are you found by potential customers?</p>
            <p><strong>3. Conversion & Performance:</strong> Where in the funnel do you lose customers? Which pages underperform? Data-driven analysis instead of guesswork.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Technology & Speed:</strong> Loading times, Core Web Vitals, code quality – the technical foundation determines ranking and user experience.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Security & Compliance:</strong> GDPR, Payment Security, SSL – identify legal and technical risks before they become problems.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Processes & Systems:</strong> How efficient is the backend? Order processing, integrations, automation – often there's untapped potential here.</p>
        - title: "When Is an Audit Worthwhile?"
          content: |
            <p>An e-commerce audit is particularly valuable before strategic decisions: Before a shop relaunch, to set the right priorities. Before a marketing offensive, to plug conversion leaks. Or simply when you feel your shop is underperforming its potential.</p>
            <p>Unlike ongoing consulting, an audit is a one-time project with a clear scope and defined deliverables. You receive a comprehensive status report and a prioritized roadmap – the implementation is then up to you or your agency.</p>
        - title: "What Happens After the Audit?"
          content: |
            <p>An audit is the first step. Based on the results, you can go directly into implementation – or first develop an <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a> that prioritizes all measures and puts them in a larger context.</p>
            <p>For ongoing support, <a href="/ecommerce-sparring">E-Commerce Sparring</a> is available, for complex projects <a href="/implementation-support">Implementation Support</a> or <a href="/project-management">Project Management</a>.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How long does an e-commerce audit take?"
          answer: "A comprehensive audit typically takes 2-4 weeks – depending on shop size and complexity. This includes preparation, analysis, report creation and presentation. For urgent cases, an express audit is also possible."
        - question: "What does an e-commerce audit cost?"
          answer: "A basic audit covering the key areas starts at €2,500. A comprehensive audit with all six areas ranges between €4,000 and €6,000, depending on shop complexity. In a preliminary discussion, we clarify which scope makes sense for you."
        - question: "What access do you need?"
          answer: "For a complete audit, I need access to: Google Analytics / Matomo, Google Search Console, Shop Backend (read-only is sufficient), and possibly other systems depending on focus. All access is removed after project completion."
        - question: "What distinguishes your audit from automated tools?"
          answer: "Automated tools deliver raw data – I deliver interpretation and prioritization. My audit combines tool analyses with manual review and business context. You don't just get a list of problems, but a roadmap with clear priorities."
        - question: "Can you also implement the measures?"
          answer: "The audit is deliberately designed as a one-time project. Implementation is up to you, your team, or your agency. If desired, I can accompany the implementation as a sparring partner – that's then part of a separate consulting agreement."
        - question: "Which shop systems do you offer audits for?"
          answer: "The audit is system-agnostic – whether Shopify, Shopware, WooCommerce, Magento, or a custom solution. The analysis methods are transferable, and technical checks are adapted to your system."
        - question: "What happens after the audit?"
          answer: "You receive the report and presentation. With that, you have everything you need for the next steps. Many clients implement the measures themselves. If desired, I offer optional implementation support or a follow-up check after 3-6 months."
        - question: "Is the audit also useful for small shops?"
          answer: "Yes – smaller shops often benefit the most, because no processes are established yet and a lot of potential lies dormant. For shops with less complexity, I offer a focused basic audit that covers the most important areas."
