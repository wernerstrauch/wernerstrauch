      sections:
        - title: "More Than an Automated Report"
          content: |
            <p>Every SEO tool produces an "audit" at the push of a button. But these automated reports only scratch the surface. A professional e-commerce audit goes deeper: it combines technical analysis with business understanding and considers your specific situation.</p>
            <p>The real work isn't in collecting data – but in interpreting and prioritizing. What does a specific finding mean for <em>your</em> business? How urgent is it? Which measure has the greatest leverage?</p>
        - title: "The Six Pillars of a Comprehensive Audit"
          content: |
            <p><strong>1. Shop & User Experience:</strong> How do real customers experience your shop? Navigation, product presentation, checkout – every touchpoint is examined for conversion killers.</p>
            <p><strong>2. SEO & Visibility:</strong> Technical SEO, on-page factors, content quality – how well are you found by potential customers?</p>
            <p><strong>3. Conversion & Performance:</strong> Where in the funnel do you lose customers? Which pages underperform? Data-driven analysis instead of guesswork.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Technology & Speed:</strong> Loading times, Core Web Vitals, code quality – the technical foundation determines ranking and user experience.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Security & Compliance:</strong> GDPR, Payment Security, SSL – identify legal and technical risks before they become problems.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Processes & Systems:</strong> How efficient is your backend? Order processing, integrations, automation – this is where hidden potential often lives.</p>
        - title: "When Is an Audit Worth It?"
          content: |
            <p>An e-commerce audit is especially valuable before major decisions: before a shop relaunch, to get your priorities straight; before a big marketing push, to fix conversion bottlenecks; or simply when you sense your shop isn't reaching its full potential.</p>
            <p>Unlike ongoing consulting, an audit is a one-time project with a clear scope and defined deliverables. You walk away with a comprehensive status report and a prioritized roadmap – implementation is up to you or your team.</p>
        - title: "What Happens After the Audit?"
          content: |
            <p>An audit is just the first step. From there, you can dive straight into implementation – or develop an <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a> that prioritizes everything and ties it into the bigger picture.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How long does an e-commerce audit take?"
          answer: "A comprehensive audit typically takes 2-4 weeks – depending on shop size and complexity. This includes preparation, analysis, report creation and presentation. For urgent cases, an express audit is also possible."
        - question: "What does an e-commerce audit cost?"
          answer: "A basic audit covering the key areas starts at EUR 2,500. A comprehensive audit with all six areas runs between EUR 4,000 and EUR 6,000, depending on your shop's complexity. We'll figure out the right scope for you in an initial call."
        - question: "What access do you need?"
          answer: "For a complete audit, I need access to: Google Analytics / Matomo, Google Search Console, Shop Backend (read-only is sufficient), and possibly other systems depending on focus. All access is removed after project completion."
        - question: "How is your audit different from automated tools?"
          answer: "Automated tools give you raw data – I give you insights and priorities. My audit combines tool analysis with hands-on review and real business context. You don't just get a list of problems; you get a roadmap showing exactly what to tackle first."
        - question: "Can you help with implementation too?"
          answer: "The audit is intentionally a one-time project. Implementation is up to you, your team, or your agency. That said, I can support the rollout as a sparring partner if needed – we'd set that up as a separate engagement."
        - question: "Which e-commerce platforms do you audit?"
          answer: "The audit is platform-agnostic – Shopify, Shopware, WooCommerce, Magento, or custom builds. The analysis methods transfer across platforms, and technical checks are tailored to your specific system."
        - question: "What happens after the audit?"
          answer: "You get the report and presentation – everything you need to take the next steps. Most clients handle implementation themselves. If you'd like, I also offer optional implementation support or a follow-up check 3-6 months down the road."
        - question: "Is an audit useful for smaller shops?"
          answer: "Absolutely – smaller shops often benefit the most. Processes aren't set in stone yet, and there's usually untapped potential waiting to be discovered. For less complex shops, I offer a focused basic audit that covers the essentials."
