      description: 'Got more questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Reach out</a> anytime.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How is sparring different from consulting?"
          answer: "Traditional consulting is project-based: you have a problem, I hand you a solution. Sparring is ongoing and conversational. I don't give you ready-made answers – I help you think through decisions and come to better conclusions yourself. It's about the process, not just the output."
        - question: "Who is sparring right for?"
          answer: "Sparring works best for founders, CEOs, and e-commerce leaders who regularly face strategic decisions and want a trusted sounding board. My typical clients are CEOs, heads of e-commerce, or founders scaling their online businesses."
        - question: "How often do we meet?"
          answer: "Usually 2-4 times per month, depending on what you need. Most clients start with weekly calls, then shift to every other week once things settle. We can adjust the cadence anytime – it flexes with your workload."
        - question: "What does sparring cost?"
          answer: "Sparring starts at EUR 1,500 per month (plus VAT) for 2 sessions. Need more? There are packages with 4 sessions and extended async support. The minimum commitment is 3 months."
        - question: "Can I reach you between sessions?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Async support is baked into the retainer. Fire off quick questions via email or Slack anytime, or prep topics for our next call. For bigger discussions, we schedule a session."
        - question: "What does a typical session look like?"
          answer: "You bring whatever's on your mind. We prioritize together, then work through it systematically. I ask questions, offer perspective, and we develop approaches together. We wrap up with clear decisions and next steps."
        - question: "What if I need to reschedule?"
          answer: "Life happens. Reschedule up to 24 hours in advance, no questions asked. Unused sessions roll over to the next month – I'm big on flexibility."
        - question: "Can I cancel anytime?"
          answer: "After the initial 3 months, you can cancel with one month's notice. I'm not interested in locking anyone in – if sparring stops adding value, we wrap it up. That said, many partnerships evolve into deeper project work over time."
