      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "What distinguishes sparring from consulting?"
          answer: "Consulting is often project-based: You have a problem, I deliver a solution. Sparring is continuous and dialogical. I don't give ready-made answers, but help you make better decisions yourself. The focus is on the process, not just the result."
        - question: "Who is sparring suitable for?"
          answer: "Sparring is suitable for entrepreneurs and e-commerce leaders who regularly need to make strategic decisions and want an experienced exchange partner. Typical sparring partners are managing directors, e-commerce managers or founders with growing online businesses."
        - question: "How often do we meet?"
          answer: "Depending on need, 2-4 times per month. Most sparrings start with weekly sessions and then move to bi-weekly rhythm. We can adjust the frequency at any time – depending on how much is going on."
        - question: "What does sparring cost?"
          answer: "Sparring starts at €1,500 per month (plus VAT) for 2 sessions. For more intensive support with 4 sessions and extended asynchronous support, there are expanded packages. The minimum term is 3 months."
        - question: "Can I also ask questions in between?"
          answer: "Yes, asynchronous support is included in the retainer. Via email or messenger, you can ask short questions at any time or prepare topics for the next conversation. For more extensive topics, we then schedule a session."
        - question: "How does a typical session work?"
          answer: "You bring the topics that currently concern you. We prioritize together and then work through them in a structured way. I ask questions, bring in perspectives, we develop solution approaches. At the end, we document decisions and next steps."
        - question: "What if I need to cancel?"
          answer: "No problem – you can reschedule up to 24 hours in advance. Unused sessions don't expire but are transferred to the next month. Flexibility is important to me."
        - question: "Can I end the sparring at any time?"
          answer: "After the 3-month minimum term, there's a monthly cancellation period. I don't bind anyone longer than necessary – if the sparring no longer adds value, we end it. Often, however, the collaboration develops further, e.g., toward project support."
