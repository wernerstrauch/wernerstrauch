      faqs:
        - question: "Which service is right for me?"
          answer: "It depends on where you are. For discrete projects like an ERP switch or platform migration, focused consulting or implementation support usually makes sense. If you need strategic clarity, an audit or strategy engagement is the right starting point. For ongoing support, the sparring model works well. We can figure out the best fit in a quick intro call."
        - question: "Can I combine multiple services?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Many clients start with an audit, then move into sparring or implementation support as things progress. The services are designed to work together. We'll map out the right combination during our first conversation."
        - question: "What does it cost?"
          answer: "It depends on scope. One-time engagements like audits start at EUR 2,500; ongoing advisory starts at EUR 1,500/month. I'm happy to give you a ballpark for your specific situation on a free intro call. No strings attached."
        - question: "How quickly can we start?"
          answer: "Typically within 1-2 weeks. For urgent situations, I'll find a way. After our intro call I'll send a proposal, and we kick off as soon as you're ready."
        - question: "Do you work on-site?"
          answer: "Mostly remote, but I'm happy to travel for workshops, kick-offs, or intensive project phases. Most clients appreciate the flexibility of remote, but sometimes in-person is just better."
        - question: "How does the intro call work?"
          answer: "It's free and takes about 30 minutes. We'll talk through your current situation, goals, and challenges. I'll share initial thoughts and we'll figure out which service makes sense. No pressure, no hidden fees."
