      faqs:
        - question: "Which service is right for me?"
          answer: "That depends on your situation. For specific projects (ERP change, shop migration), focused consulting or implementation support often makes sense. For strategic clarity, I recommend an audit or strategy project. For ongoing support, there's the sparring model. In our initial call, we'll figure out together what fits."
        - question: "Can I combine multiple services?"
          answer: "Yes, absolutely. Many clients start with an audit and then move into sparring or implementation support. The services are modular and complement each other. In our initial call, we'll develop the right combination."
        - question: "What does a collaboration cost?"
          answer: "Costs vary depending on the service and scope. One-time services like audits start at €2,500, ongoing support from €1,500/month. In our initial call, I'll give you an initial estimate for your specific situation – non-binding and free of charge."
        - question: "How quickly can we start?"
          answer: "Usually within 1-2 weeks. For urgent matters, we'll find a solution. After the initial call, I'll create a proposal, and once commissioned, we get started."
        - question: "Do you also work on-site?"
          answer: "Primarily remote, but I'm happy to come to you for workshops, kick-offs, or intensive project phases. Most clients appreciate the flexibility of remote sessions – but sometimes an on-site meeting is simply more valuable."
        - question: "How does the initial call work?"
          answer: "The initial call is free and takes about 30 minutes. We discuss your current situation, goals, and challenges. I provide initial assessments and we clarify which service would make sense. Non-binding and without hidden costs."
