        - title: "Headless Commerce"
          content: |
            <p>In Headless Commerce, the frontend (the "head") is decoupled from the backend. The shop talks to the commerce system through APIs. This gives you maximum flexibility in frontend design and lets you connect any touchpoint.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Complete design freedom, faster frontend development, multi-touchpoint ready. <strong>Cons:</strong> More complexity, more development work, requires a strong tech team.</p>
        - title: "MACH Architecture"
          content: |
            <p>MACH stands for Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless. These principles describe a modern, flexible e-commerce architecture built on best-of-breed components.</p>
            <p>Instead of one monolithic system, you pick specialized services for each function: Commerce, Search, CMS, Payments. The challenge? Orchestrating them all and managing increased operational complexity.</p>
        - title: "Composable Commerce"
          content: |
            <p>Composable Commerce takes it even further: your entire e-commerce platform is assembled from swappable components. Each piece can be replaced or extended independently.</p>
            <p>This approach offers maximum flexibility, but it also demands serious technical expertise and clear governance. It's not the right fit for every business.</p>
        - title: "Making the Right Decision"
          content: |
            <p>Classic monolith, Headless, or Composable – there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The best architecture depends on your business model, technical capabilities, and growth goals. The answer lives in your <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a>.</p>
            <p>Once you've made the technology decision, I can support you with <a href="/project-management">Project Management</a> or <a href="/implementation-support">Implementation Support</a> – so execution goes as smoothly as the selection process.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "At what company size does technology consulting make sense?"
          answer: "Structured technology consulting typically pays off once you hit 2-3 million euros in annual revenue, or when you're facing a major system decision. For smaller retailers, a strategy session is often enough to point you in the right direction."
        - question: "Do you recommend specific systems or vendors?"
          answer: "I'm completely independent – no commissions from software vendors. My recommendations are based on your requirements alone. And sometimes that means I'll recommend sticking with your current system and optimizing it instead."
        - question: "How long does a typical selection process take?"
          answer: "A full selection process with RFP and PoC typically takes 3-6 months. A quicker screening with shortlist recommendation can be done in 4-6 weeks. Timeline depends on complexity and how fast your organization can make decisions."
        - question: "Do you support implementation too?"
          answer: "Yes, as your owner-side representative. I don't write code myself, but I make sure the implementation meets your requirements, join workshops, review milestones, and handle vendor coordination when needed."
        - question: "What's the difference between RFI and RFP?"
          answer: "An RFI (Request for Information) is an initial inquiry to learn about vendors and their offerings. An RFP (Request for Proposal) is a detailed tender with specific requirements, asking for a binding proposal. I use both – depending on where you are in the selection process."
        - question: "Do I really need a PIM system?"
          answer: "Not always. A PIM makes sense if you have 500-1000+ products, sell through multiple channels, or manage complex product data. For smaller shops, your e-commerce platform often handles it just fine. I'll help you figure out what's right for you."
        - question: "What does technology consulting cost?"
          answer: "An initial architecture assessment starts at EUR 3,500. A full selection process with RFP and decision brief typically runs between EUR 8,000 and EUR 15,000 – depending on complexity and the number of systems being evaluated."
        - question: "Is Headless Commerce the future?"
          answer: "Headless is powerful, but it's not for everyone. For retailers with straightforward needs, modern platforms like Shopify Plus or Shopware are often the smarter choice. Headless shines when you have complex frontend requirements, multi-touchpoint strategies, or a strong in-house tech team."
