        - title: "Headless Commerce"
          content: |
            <p>In Headless Commerce, the frontend (the "head") is decoupled from the backend. The shop communicates via APIs with the commerce system. This enables maximum flexibility in frontend design and the connection of any touchpoints.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Full design freedom, fast frontend development, multi-touchpoint capability. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Higher complexity, more development effort, requires strong tech teams.</p>
        - title: "MACH Architecture"
          content: |
            <p>MACH stands for Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native and Headless. These principles describe a modern, flexible e-commerce architecture that relies on best-of-breed components.</p>
            <p>Instead of a monolithic system, you choose specialized services for each area: Commerce, Search, CMS, Payments. The challenge lies in orchestration and increased operational effort.</p>
        - title: "Composable Commerce"
          content: |
            <p>Composable Commerce goes one step further: The entire e-commerce platform is assembled from interchangeable components. Each component can be independently replaced or extended.</p>
            <p>This approach offers maximum flexibility, but also requires considerable technical competence and clear governance. It's not the right path for every company.</p>
        - title: "Making the Right Decision"
          content: |
            <p>Whether classic monolith, Headless or Composable – there's no universally correct answer. The best architecture depends on your business model, technical competence and growth goals. The answer lies in your <a href="/ecommerce-strategy">E-Commerce Strategy</a>.</p>
            <p>After the technology decision, I support you if desired with <a href="/project-management">Project Management</a> or <a href="/implementation-support">Implementation Support</a> – so the implementation runs as smoothly as the selection.</p>

      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "At what company size does technology consulting make sense?"
          answer: "Structured technology consulting typically pays off from an annual revenue of 2-3 million euros or when you're facing a major system decision. For smaller retailers, a strategy discussion is often sufficient to set the right course."
        - question: "Do you recommend specific systems or vendors?"
          answer: "I'm independent and don't receive commissions from software vendors. My recommendations are based solely on your requirements. This also means: Sometimes I recommend keeping and optimizing the existing system."
        - question: "How long does a typical selection process take?"
          answer: "A complete selection process with RFP and PoC typically takes 3-6 months. A faster screening with shortlist recommendation is possible in 4-6 weeks. Duration depends on complexity and your internal decision speed."
        - question: "Do you also accompany implementation?"
          answer: "Yes, as owner on the client side. I don't implement myself, but I ensure the implementation meets your requirements, accompany workshops, review milestones and coordinate vendor management as needed."
        - question: "What's the difference between RFI and RFP?"
          answer: "An RFI (Request for Information) is an initial information request to get to know vendors. An RFP (Request for Proposal) is a detailed tender with specific requirements and the request for a binding offer. I use both instruments – depending on the phase in the selection process."
        - question: "Do I really need a PIM system?"
          answer: "Not necessarily. A PIM is worthwhile if you have more than 500-1000 products, serve multiple sales channels, or maintain complex product data. For smaller shops, the shop system is often sufficient. I help you make the right decision."
        - question: "What does technology consulting cost?"
          answer: "An initial architecture assessment starts at €3,500. A complete selection process with RFP and decision template typically costs between €8,000 and €15,000 – depending on complexity and number of systems to evaluate."
        - question: "Is Headless Commerce the future?"
          answer: "Headless is a powerful approach, but not for everyone. For retailers with standardized requirements, modern monoliths like Shopify Plus or Shopware are often the better choice. Headless makes sense with complex frontend requirements, multi-touchpoint strategies, or if you have a strong tech team."
