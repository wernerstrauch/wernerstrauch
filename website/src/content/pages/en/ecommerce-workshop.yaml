      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How long does a workshop take?"
          answer: "Depending on the scope, between half a day (3-4 hours) and two full days. A classic strategy workshop takes one day. In the preliminary discussion, we clarify which format makes sense for your goals."
        - question: "How many participants are ideal?"
          answer: "Between 2 and 10 people. With fewer, perspective diversity is often missing; with more, moderation becomes more difficult. Ideally, decision-makers from different areas participate: management, e-commerce, marketing, operations."
        - question: "On-site or remote?"
          answer: "Both are possible. On-site workshops enable more intensive collaboration and spontaneous whiteboard sessions. Remote workshops are more flexible and save travel time. Often a hybrid approach makes sense: strategy sessions on-site, follow-ups remote."
        - question: "What do I need to prepare?"
          answer: "I'll send you a questionnaire in advance and a list of access/data I need for preparation (analytics, shop backend, etc.). The better the preparation, the more productive the workshop day."
        - question: "What does a workshop cost?"
          answer: "A half-day workshop starts at €2,500, a full-day workshop at €3,500, a two-day intensive at €6,000 – each plus VAT and travel costs if applicable. Preparation, execution and documentation are included in the price."
        - question: "What do I get at the end?"
          answer: "Comprehensive documentation of all results: analysis insights, strategic decisions, prioritized measures and a roadmap with timeline. Not a slide graveyard, but a working document you can use directly."
        - question: "Can the workshop also be part of a longer consulting engagement?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Many of my clients start with a workshop as a kick-off for longer-term collaboration. The workshop creates the strategic foundation, <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>E-Commerce Sparring</a> ensures continuous support, and <a href='/implementation-support'>Implementation Support</a> ensures quality in implementation."
