      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How long does a workshop take?"
          answer: "Anywhere from half a day (3-4 hours) to two full days, depending on the scope. A typical strategy workshop runs one day. We'll figure out the right format for your goals during our initial call."
        - question: "How many participants are ideal?"
          answer: "Between 2 and 10 people. Fewer than that and you miss diverse perspectives; more and it's hard to keep everyone engaged. Ideally, you'll have decision-makers from across the business: leadership, e-commerce, marketing, and operations."
        - question: "On-site or remote?"
          answer: "Either works. On-site workshops allow for deeper collaboration and spontaneous whiteboard sessions. Remote is more flexible and saves travel time. A hybrid approach often makes the most sense: strategy sessions in person, follow-ups over video."
        - question: "What do I need to prepare?"
          answer: "I'll send you a questionnaire ahead of time, along with a list of data and access I'll need (analytics, shop backend, etc.). The better prepared we are, the more we'll accomplish on workshop day."
        - question: "What does a workshop cost?"
          answer: "Half-day workshops start at EUR 2,500, full-day at EUR 3,500, and two-day intensives at EUR 6,000 – each plus VAT and travel if applicable. Prep, facilitation, and documentation are all included."
        - question: "What do I get at the end?"
          answer: "Full documentation of everything we cover: analysis findings, strategic decisions, prioritized action items, and a timeline-based roadmap. Not a slide deck that collects dust – a working document you can act on immediately."
        - question: "Can the workshop be part of a longer engagement?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Many clients use the workshop as a kick-off for ongoing collaboration. It lays the strategic foundation, <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>E-Commerce Sparring</a> provides continuous support, and <a href='/implementation-support'>Implementation Support</a> ensures quality execution."
