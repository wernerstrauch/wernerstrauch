      headline: "Questions About <em>Implementation Support</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "How are you different from a project manager?"
          answer: "A project manager is embedded in the project and makes day-to-day decisions. I deliberately stay a step removed: I question, review, and advise - but you call the shots. That distance lets me stay critical without any conflicts of interest."
        - question: "How much of your time will I need?"
          answer: "It depends on the project phase. During crunch times (kickoff, go-live), expect 6-8 days per month. During calmer stretches, 2-3 days. We'll define a framework that fits your project."
        - question: "Will you work with our agency?"
          answer: "Absolutely - that's the norm. I'm not competing with your agency; I'm your advocate on the client side. Good agencies actually appreciate this, because clear requirements and fast decisions make their lives easier too."
        - question: "What's the minimum project size where this makes sense?"
          answer: "Rule of thumb: for projects over EUR 50,000 or lasting more than 3 months, independent support is worth it. For smaller projects, a one-time <a href='/ecommerce-audit'>Audit</a> or <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>Sparring session</a> is usually a better fit."
        - question: "Can I bring you in for specific phases only?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Some clients bring me in just for the concept phase, others only for go-live assurance. We can focus the engagement on whichever phases are most critical."
        - question: "What does implementation support cost?"
          answer: "Monthly support ranges from EUR 1,500 for 2 days per month up to EUR 4,000 for 8 days. For longer engagements, package pricing is available. We'll figure out the right scope during our initial call."
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Typically within 1-2 weeks. For urgent projects, I can often find a faster solution. Just get in touch."
        - question: "What if there are conflicts with the vendor?"
          answer: "I facilitate and mediate - but I'm unambiguously in your corner. When real conflicts arise, I help document issues, define escalation paths, and evaluate alternatives if needed."
