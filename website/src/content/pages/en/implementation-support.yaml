      headline: "Questions About <em>Implementation Support</em>"
      description: 'Still have questions? <a href="/contact" class="faq__link">Contact me</a> directly.'
      faqs:
        - question: "What distinguishes you from a project manager?"
          answer: "A project manager is part of the project and makes operational decisions. I deliberately take a step back: I question, review and advise – but you make the decisions. This allows me to remain critical without getting into conflicts of interest."
        - question: "How much time should I plan for?"
          answer: "Effort varies by project phase: During peak times (kick-off, go-live), it can be 6-8 days per month, during quieter phases 2-3 days. We define a framework together that fits your project."
        - question: "Do you also work with our agency?"
          answer: "Yes, that's the normal case. I'm not a competitor to your agency, but your representative on the client side. Good agencies appreciate this – because clear requirements and quick decisions help them too."
        - question: "From what project size does support make sense?"
          answer: "As a rule of thumb: For projects from €50,000 in volume or from 3 months duration, independent support is worthwhile. For smaller projects, a one-time <a href='/ecommerce-audit'>Audit</a> or <a href='/ecommerce-sparring'>Sparring</a> often makes more sense."
        - question: "Can I book you only for certain phases?"
          answer: "Absolutely. Some clients book me only for the concept phase, others only for go-live assurance. We can flexibly focus the support on critical phases."
        - question: "What does implementation support cost?"
          answer: "Monthly support starts at €1,500 for 2 days per month and goes up to €4,000 for 8 days per month. For longer projects, package prices are also possible. In the initial call, we clarify what scope makes sense for your project."
        - question: "How quickly can you start?"
          answer: "Usually I can start within 1-2 weeks. For urgent projects, we'll find shorter-term solutions as well. Just reach out to me."
        - question: "What happens if there are conflicts with the vendor?"
          answer: "I moderate and mediate – but I'm clearly on your side. In real conflicts, I help to document them, define escalation paths and, if necessary, evaluate alternatives."
